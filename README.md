# Perception Engine

⚡ **Perception Engine** is a high-performance, open-source C++ game engine built from scratch — for learning, experimentation, and fun.

It's designed with a focus on:
- **Clean architecture**
- **Performance-first mindset**
- **Learning by doing**  
No external ECS or game frameworks used. Everything is custom.

## ✅ Current Features

### 🏗️ Core Systems
- **Custom Entity-Component-System (ECS)**
  - Stable memory layout (no archetypes)
  - Parent-child hierarchies with clean attach/detach logic
  - Safe component lifecycle management (create, update, destroy)
  - Interned string pooling for fast lookups & name encryption support (like UE4 FName)

### 🧹 Destruction & GC System
- **Safe destruction queue for entities & components**
  - Multi-thread friendly (frame & physics tick safe)
  - Supports delayed destruction (per-thread tick tracking)
  - Force-deletion for layers/levels (bulk cleanup)
- **Global GC loop running at fixed intervals**

### ⚙️ Transform System Overhaul
- Queued transform updates (position, rotation, scale deltas)
- Dirty flag optimization (only recomputes when needed)
- Parent-relative world transformation with inverse-combine logic

### 🧪 Performance Tested
- ✅ 50,000+ entities with deep hierarchies stress-tested
- ✅ Stable update performance across frame & physics threads

## 💡 Why?
This is a personal journey to understand how modern game engines (like Unreal, Unity) work under the hood — not by reading, but by **building**.

I’m documenting & sharing this project openly to help others who want to learn low-level engine architecture.
